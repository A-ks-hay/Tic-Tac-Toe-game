## 🧠 Introduction

This project is a classic **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid.  
The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.  
If all the spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a **draw**.
